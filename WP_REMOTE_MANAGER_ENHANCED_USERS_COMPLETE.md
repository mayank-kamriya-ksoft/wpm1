# WordPress Remote Manager Enhanced Users Plugin - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The WP Remote Manager Enhanced Users Plugin v3.1.0 has been successfully developed to address user metadata retrieval limitations in the WordPress Remote Manager dashboard. This plugin provides enhanced user information including email addresses while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced User Metadata
- **Email Address Retrieval**: Users now display actual email addresses instead of "Private (WordPress security)"
- **Detailed User Information**: Includes display names, roles, capabilities, and metadata
- **ManageWP Compatibility**: Maintains same data structure as ManageWP for seamless integration

### 2. Improved API Endpoints
- **Primary Endpoint**: `/wp-json/wrms/v1/users` (secure version)
- **Fallback Endpoint**: `/wp-json/wrm/v1/users` (legacy compatibility)
- **Detailed Endpoint**: `/wp-json/wrms/v1/users/detailed` for comprehensive user data

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Clear API Key Validation**: Distinguishes between incorrect API keys and plugin installation issues
- **Specific Error Messages**: Users receive actionable error messages instead of confusing "plugin not found" errors
- **Validation Endpoint**: New `/api/websites/:id/validate-api-key` for quick API key verification

### 4. Security Features
- **CSRF Protection**: Nonce verification for all requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent request throttling (60 requests per minute)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity logging for security monitoring
- **Secure API Key Management**: Enterprise-grade key generation and validation
- **Input Validation**: Robust sanitization and validation of all inputs
