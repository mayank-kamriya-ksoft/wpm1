# Rate Limiting Issue Fix for KSoft Solution

## Problem Identified
The secure plugin's rate limiting (60 requests/minute) is being triggered by the dashboard making multiple rapid requests, causing 429 errors.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Dashboard Client
- **Increased request interval**: 3 seconds between requests
- **Added automatic retry**: 65-second wait on rate limiting
- **Added fallback mechanism**: Try legacy endpoint if secure fails
- **Better error handling**: Clear rate limit messages

### 2. Alternative Configuration (for KSoft Solution)

If you need higher request limits for your specific use case, you can modify the secure plugin:

#### Option A: Increase Rate Limit (Recommended)
Edit `wp-remote-manager-secure.php` line 39:
```php
// Change from 60 to 120 requests per minute
const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 120;
```

#### Option B: Disable Rate Limiting (Not Recommended for Production)
Edit `wp-remote-manager-secure.php` in the `check_rate_limit` function:
```php
public static function check_rate_limit($api_key = null) {
    // Temporarily disable rate limiting
    return true;
    
    // Original code (commented out)
    // $client_id = $api_key ? hash('sha256', $api_key) : self::get_client_ip();
    // ... rest of function
}
```

## Immediate Steps for KSoft Solution

### Step 1: Clear Rate Limit Cache
In WordPress admin, go to your caching plugin and clear all caches, or add this to your WordPress `wp-config.php` temporarily:
```php
// Clear transients (rate limit cache)
delete_transient('wrms_rate_limit_*');
```

### Step 2: Wait for Rate Limit Reset
- Current rate limits reset every 60 seconds
- Wait 2 minutes before testing again
- The updated dashboard client will handle this automatically

### Step 3: Test with Updated Client
The dashboard now includes:
- Automatic 3-second delays between requests
- Retry logic for rate limiting
- Fallback to legacy endpoints

## Monitoring Dashboard Updates

### Watch for These Log Messages:
```
[WRM] Rate limiting: waiting 3000ms before next request
[WRM] Rate limited, waiting 65 seconds before retry...
[WRM] Secure endpoint not found, trying legacy: /status
```

These indicate the new protective measures are working.

## Production Configuration Recommendations

### For High-Traffic Sites:
```php
const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 120; // Double the limit
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60; // Keep 60-second window
```

### For Development/Testing:
```php
const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 300; // Higher limit for testing
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60;
```

### For Single Dashboard Use:
```php
const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 60; // Standard limit (current setting)
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60;
```

## Updated Plugin File

The dashboard client has been automatically updated with:
- Better rate limiting handling
- Automatic retry mechanisms  
- Fallback endpoint support
- Enhanced error messages

No action needed on the dashboard side - the fixes are already applied.

## Testing the Fix

1. **Wait 2 minutes** for any existing rate limits to clear
2. **Refresh** your WordPress Maintenance Dashboard
3. **Navigate** to the KSoft Solution website details
4. **Check** that data loads without rate limit errors

The system will now automatically handle rate limiting gracefully with proper delays and retries.
