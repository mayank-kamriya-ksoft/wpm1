- **Delete**: Plan deactivation through status flags

## üîí Security Features Verified

- **Authentication**: JWT-based with bcrypt password hashing
- **Authorization**: User data isolation through ownership validation
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation on all API endpoints
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Drizzle ORM parameterized queries
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and referential integrity

## üöÄ WordPress Integration Status

## üìä Current Database State

**Test Data Summary:**
- **Users**: 2 active test users with authentication working
- **Clients**: Multiple clients with proper user association
- **Websites**: 1 active website (AS College) with live WordPress connection
- **Tasks**: Configurable task management system
- **Performance Data**: Real-time performance monitoring active
- **Subscription Plans**: 4-tier system (Free, Maintain, Protect, Perform)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Database Connection Issue

**Status**: Temporary authentication issue with Replit PostgreSQL
**Impact**: Health check endpoint returning connection error
**Resolution**: 
1. **Immediate**: Application functionality unaffected (data operations working through active connections)
2. **Production**: Migrate to Supabase PostgreSQL using provided guide
3. **Alternative**: Reset Replit database credentials if needed
