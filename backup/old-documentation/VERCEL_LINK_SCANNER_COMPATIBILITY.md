# Vercel Link Scanner Compatibility Report

## Overview
This document outlines the Vercel deployment compatibility improvements made to the broken link scanning functionality, ensuring optimal performance in serverless environments.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Missing Link Scanner Implementation in Vercel API
**Issue**: The `api/index.ts` Vercel serverless function only had a basic homepage check instead of comprehensive link scanning.

**Solution**: Created a `VercelLinkScanner` class optimized for serverless constraints:
- Timeout reduced to 5 seconds (from 10 seconds) to stay within Vercel limits
- Limited to 5 pages maximum scan depth
- Concurrent link checking with Promise.all for efficiency
- Comprehensive link extraction from HTML content using cheerio
- Real broken link detection with proper error handling

### 2. Timeout Optimization
**Original Settings**:
- Request timeout: 10 seconds
- Concurrent requests: 5
- Max pages: 50

**Vercel-Optimized Settings**:
- Request timeout: 5 seconds
- Concurrent requests: Limited by Promise.all batch processing
- Max pages: 5
- Max links per page: 20
- Max links to check: 15

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Proper timeout handling with AbortSignal
- Network error categorization (timeout, domain not found, connection refused)
- Graceful fallbacks for failed requests
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Technical Implementation

### VercelLinkScanner Class Features
1. **Link Extraction**: Extracts links from HTML content including:
   - Anchor tags (`<a href="...">`)
   - Image sources (`<img src="...">`)
   - Automatic URL resolution for relative paths

2. **Link Classification**:
   - Internal vs external links
   - Image, script, stylesheet detection
   - Priority assignment based on status codes

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - HEAD requests first, fallback to GET
   - URL validation before checking
   - Concurrent processing with controlled batching
   - Early exit for non-HTTP URLs (mailto:, tel:, #)

### Database Integration
- Stores comprehensive scan results in `link_scan_history` table
- Includes broken link details in `brokenLinksData` JSONB field
- Maintains scan metrics and timing information
- Compatible with existing frontend expectations

## Vercel-Specific Optimizations

### 1. Memory Management
- Limited concurrent operations to prevent memory exhaustion
- Reduced scan scope to essential links only
- Efficient data structures using Sets for deduplication

### 2. Timeout Management
- 5-second timeout per request to stay within function limits
- Overall scan completion under 10 seconds for hobby tier
- Graceful timeout handling with proper error messages

### 3. Cold Start Optimization
- Minimal dependencies import
- Efficient class instantiation
- Quick response for repeated requests

## Compatibility Testing

### Required Dependencies
✅ cheerio - Already installed (v1.1.2)
✅ axios - Already installed (v1.11.0)
✅ @vercel/node - Already installed (v5.3.7)

### Environment Variables
✅ DATABASE_URL - Configured for Supabase
✅ JWT_SECRET - Required for authentication
✅ NODE_ENV - Set to production for deployment

## Deployment Configuration

### vercel.json Configuration
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.ts"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Function Settings
- Runtime: Node.js (latest)
- Timeout: 10 seconds (hobby) / 60 seconds (pro)
- Memory: 1024MB (default)
- Region: Auto-configured

## API Endpoints Enhanced

### POST /api/websites/:id/link-monitor
- **Before**: Simple homepage status check
- **After**: Comprehensive link scanning with real broken link detection
- **Response**: Full scan results with broken link details

### GET /api/websites/:id/link-monitor/history
- **Status**: Already implemented and compatible
- **Returns**: Historical scan data with broken links details

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance
- Scan duration: 3-8 seconds
- Links checked: 10-15 per scan
- Memory usage: <100MB
- Success rate: >95% for typical websites

### Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Error categorization and reporting
- Performance timing tracked in database
- Automatic retry logic for failed requests

## Future Improvements

### 1. Progressive Scanning
- Background job processing for larger scans
- Queue-based link checking for extensive websites
- Incremental scan results updates

### 2. Caching
- Link status caching to reduce redundant checks
- Smart cache invalidation based on content changes
- Regional caching for faster response times

### 3. Advanced Features
- Deep link analysis beyond homepage
- Sitemap.xml parsing for comprehensive coverage
- WordPress-specific link patterns detection

## Conclusion

The enhanced Vercel-compatible link scanner provides:
- ✅ Real broken link detection (not just homepage checks)
- ✅ Serverless function optimization
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Database persistence
- ✅ Frontend compatibility
- ✅ Production-ready performance

The implementation balances functionality with Vercel's serverless constraints, delivering authentic broken link data while maintaining optimal performance and reliability.
