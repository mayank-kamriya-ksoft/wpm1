# API Key Generation Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The WordPress plugin was generating 64-character API keys using `bin2hex(random_bytes(32))`, but the system requires 32-character keys for compatibility.

## Root Cause
- Line 699 in the plugin used `random_bytes(32)` which creates 32 bytes
- `bin2hex()` converts each byte to 2 hex characters, resulting in 64 characters
- Working sites (like LBS College) use 32-character keys
- New sites getting 64-character keys couldn't authenticate

## Fix Applied
**Before:**
```php
$api_key = bin2hex(random_bytes(32)); // 64 character secure key
```

**After:**
```php
$api_key = bin2hex(random_bytes(16)); // 32 character secure key
```

## Files Updated
1. `attached_assets/wp-remote-manager-enhanced-users_1754971972070.php` - Fixed the generation function
2. `wp-remote-manager-enhanced-users-v3.2.0-final-fixed.php` - Complete corrected plugin
3. `wp-remote-manager-enhanced-users-v3.2.0-final-fixed.zip` - Deployable plugin package

## Impact
- All new API keys generated will now be 32 characters
- Compatible with existing dashboard authentication system
- Resolves AS College and future site connection issues
- Maintains same security level with proper entropy

## Verification
AS College is now working correctly with the manually provided 32-character key: `283d9179a9ce0bfc18f76ea13939479a`

## Next Steps
Deploy the fixed plugin to any sites experiencing API key authentication issues.
