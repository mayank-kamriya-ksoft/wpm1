# Deployment Guide for WP ProCare

This application is designed as a full-stack Express.js application with both frontend and backend code. Here are the recommended deployment options:

## Option 1: Replit Deployments (Recommended)
The application is optimized for Replit Deployments which handles:
- Automatic builds using the existing build script
- Environment variable management
- Database connections
- Full-stack application hosting

**Steps:**
1. Use the "Deploy" button in Replit
2. Set up your environment variables (DATABASE_URL, etc.)
3. The application will be available at your `.replit.app` domain

## Option 2: Railway.app
Railway is excellent for full-stack applications:
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Railway will automatically detect and deploy the Express.js app
3. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
4. Automatic deployments on code changes

## Option 3: Render.com
1. Create a new Web Service
2. Connect your repository
3. Build Command: `npm run build`
4. Start Command: `npm start`
5. Set environment variables

## Option 4: Vercel (Frontend Only - Limited)
**Important**: Vercel deployment will only serve the static frontend files. The backend API will not work, making this suitable only for frontend preview.

If you want to use Vercel for the frontend:
1. The frontend will be served as a static site
2. You'll need to deploy the backend separately (Railway, Heroku, etc.)
3. Update the API endpoints in the frontend to point to your backend URL

## Current Vercel Issue
The "code page" you're seeing on Vercel is likely because:
1. The build isn't completing properly
2. The routing isn't configured correctly for the full-stack app
3. Vercel is trying to serve raw files instead of the built application

## Updated Vercel Configuration (July 23, 2025)
Updated vercel.json to handle both frontend and backend:
- Added @vercel/node for the Express.js backend
- Configured API routes to go to the server
- Set proper build commands

However, for database connectivity and full functionality, Replit Deployments or Railway.app are still recommended.

## Recommended Solution
For the best experience with this full-stack application, use **Replit Deployments** or **Railway.app** instead of Vercel, as they are designed to handle full-stack Node.js applications properly.
