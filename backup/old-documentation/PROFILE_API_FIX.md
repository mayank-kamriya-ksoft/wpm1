# Profile API Fix - Personal Information Update Error

## Issue Fixed âœ…
The Personal Information page on `/profile` was showing "API endpoint not found" error when trying to update user details. This occurred because the profile management endpoints were missing from the Vercel serverless function.

## Root Cause
The profile update functionality worked locally but failed on Vercel because the serverless function (`api/index.ts`) was missing the following endpoints:
- `GET /api/profile` - Fetch user profile data
- `PUT /api/profile` - Update user profile information  
- `PUT /api/profile/password` - Change user password

## Solution Applied
Added complete profile management endpoints to the serverless function:

### 1. GET /api/profile
- Authenticates user via JWT token
- Returns complete user profile data including:
  - Personal information (name, email, phone, company, bio, website, location)
  - Notification preferences
  - Subscription details
  - Account timestamps

### 2. PUT /api/profile  
- Authenticates user via JWT token
- Updates user profile fields
- Returns updated profile data
- Includes proper error handling

### 3. PUT /api/profile/password
- Authenticates user via JWT token
- Verifies current password using bcrypt
- Hashes and updates new password
- Returns success confirmation

## Authentication Integration
All endpoints properly integrate with the existing JWT authentication system:
- Uses `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header format
- Validates tokens using the same JWT secret
- Returns appropriate 401 errors for unauthorized requests

## Testing Verified
- Authentication validation working correctly
- Local API endpoints responding as expected
- Serverless function updated with all necessary profile routes

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated serverless function to Vercel
2. Test profile updates on production
3. Verify password change functionality

The Personal Information page should now work correctly after deployment.
