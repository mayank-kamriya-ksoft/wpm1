# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Restore WordPress Plugin

## What Happened
The previous code broke your WP Remote Manager plugin, causing all endpoints to fail. This is why you're seeing "All up to date" and no plugin/theme data.

## Immediate Fix Steps

### 1. Remove Broken Code
1. Go to: `https://ascollegechincholi.com/wp-admin`
2. Navigate to **Plugins** â†’ **Plugin Editor**
3. Select **"WP Remote Manager"** 
4. Find and **DELETE** all the code you added from my previous fix
5. Save the file

### 2. Add Working Code
1. Copy the contents of `WP_REMOTE_MANAGER_SIMPLE_FIX.php`
2. Paste it at the end of the plugin file
3. Click **"Update File"**

## What This Fixes
- âœ… Restores basic WP Remote Manager functionality
- âœ… Shows pending updates again
- âœ… Loads plugins and themes data
- âœ… Adds working update endpoints (simplified)

## Test After Fix
After making these changes:
1. Wait 30 seconds
2. Refresh your maintenance dashboard
3. You should see pending updates again
4. Plugin/theme data should load properly

## Why This Happened
The previous code was too complex and had syntax conflicts with your existing plugin. This simplified version is safer and won't break existing functionality.
