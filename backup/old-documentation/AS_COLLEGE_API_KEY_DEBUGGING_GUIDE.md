# AS College API Key Debugging Guide

## Current Status
✅ New plugin installed successfully (wrms/v1 endpoints available)
❌ API key authentication still failing (403 Invalid API key)

## Diagnosed Issue
The new plugin is active, but there's a mismatch between:
- **Dashboard API Key**: `a917dab03960b7eae81dc9458dc4a11cc90acbd3fef6df20924a88273320d8ac`
- **WordPress Stored Key**: Different/cached value

## Immediate Solution Steps

### Step 1: Verify Plugin Installation
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Plugins
2. Confirm "WP Remote Manager - Enhanced Users v3.2.0 Final" is activated
3. Deactivate any other WP Remote Manager plugins

### Step 2: Generate Fresh API Key
1. Go to Settings → Remote Manager Enhanced
2. Click "Regenerate Key" button
3. Copy the NEW API key (it will be different)
4. Update this new key in the AIO Webcare dashboard

### Step 3: Clear WordPress Cache
1. If using any caching plugins, clear all caches
2. If using object cache, flush it
3. Restart any server-level caching

### Step 4: Test API Connection
Test the connection with: `https://ascollegechincholi.com/wp-json/wrms/v1/status`

## Alternative Solution (If Above Fails)
If the regenerated key still doesn't work:

1. **Complete Plugin Removal**:
   - Deactivate the plugin
   - Delete all WP Remote Manager plugin files
   - Remove from wp-content/plugins/

2. **Fresh Installation**:
   - Upload the new v3.2.0 Final plugin
   - Activate it
   - Generate API key
   - Test immediately

## Expected Working State
Once fixed, you should see:
- Plugin version: "3.2.0 Final" (instead of "3.2.0")
- API authentication: Success (200 OK)
- All WordPress data loading in dashboard
- Update detection working properly

## Technical Notes
The new plugin uses `hash_equals()` for secure API key comparison, which requires exact key matching. Any cache or storage issues will cause authentication failures.
