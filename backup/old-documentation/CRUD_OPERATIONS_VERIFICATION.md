## Known Limitations and Recommendations

### Current Limitations:
1. **WordPress User API**: Limited to 1 user due to WordPress REST API permissions

### Recommendations:
1. **Production Database**: Migrate to Supabase PostgreSQL for production (guide provided)
2. **WordPress API Enhancement**: Implement additional authentication methods for complete user data
3. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive error logging and monitoring
4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular automated backups for production data
